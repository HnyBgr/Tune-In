**Tune-In**

Get daily update of what happened in music history.

**Project Overview**

A pop-up or web app that will have an album cover that will display to the user.  When the user clicks on the album cover, the album will have a vinyl record slide out of the album cover and display information about events in music history from that day; musician's birthdays from that day; and No. 1 songs from that day.  
This web app will target music buffs and allow them to increase their daily knowledge of music history, help them in trivia games, and help them feel smarter when they spout of that knowledge in random social settings.  
This web app will be built with django using html, css, api's, and admin panel.
