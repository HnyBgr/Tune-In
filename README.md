**Tune-In**

Get daily update of what happened in music history.

**Project Overview**

A pop-up or web app that will have an album cover that will display to the user.  When the user uses the mouse cursor to click on the album cover, the album will flip sides and display information about events in music history from that day; musician's birthdays from that day; and No. 1 songs from that day.  
This webp app will target music buffs and allow them to increase their daily knowledge of music history, help them in trivia games, and help them feel smarter when they spout of that knowledge in random social settings.  
This web app will be built with django using css, api's, and admin panel.   

**Functionality**

Tune In

Your proposal must be in a markdown .md file more info
Your proposal must set specific and attainable goals
Your proposal must cover all major topics we've covered
Your proposal must include the sections below

Functionality
Walk through the application from the user's perspective. What will they see on each page? What can they input and click and see? How will their actions correspond to events on the back-end?

Data Model
What data will you need to store as part of your application? In this section list out all the models you'll have and the fields on each of them.

Schedule
Here you'll want to come up with some (very rough) estimates of the timeframe for each section. It's difficult to be certain how long each feature will take to develop, therefore you should plan out multiple 'milestones' for your project. That way, if you reach milestone 2 but not 3, you still have something worthwhile to present and be proud of. It also gives you the opportunity to plan out what you'd like to work on after the class is finished. For each milestone, state specifically which steps you'll take in the implementation. This section should also include work you're planning to do after the capstone is finished.
